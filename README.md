# Java Practice – StringBuilder & StringBuffer

This repository contains Java practice programs demonstrating the usage of **StringBuilder** and **StringBuffer**, two powerful classes used for creating and manipulating mutable strings.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

- Differences between `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`
- Mutability in Java
- Thread safety (in `StringBuffer`)
- Performance comparison
- Commonly used methods:
  - `append()`
  - `insert()`
  - `delete()`
  - `replace()`
  - `reverse()`
  - `capacity()`
  - `ensureCapacity()`
  - `setLength()`
  - `charAt()`
  - `setCharAt()`
  - `substring()`

## 🧵 Difference Between StringBuilder and StringBuffer

| Feature          | StringBuilder    | StringBuffer      |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Thread Safe      | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes             |
| Performance      | ✅ Faster         | ❌ Slightly Slower |
| Use Case         | Single-threaded  | Multi-threaded    |

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

By practicing with these programs, you will:
- Understand how mutable strings work in Java
- Choose the right class (`StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer`) based on thread requirements
- Efficiently manipulate strings for real-world Java applications

---

## ✅ Next Step
You can now apply this knowledge to mini-projects involving:
- Text editors
- Palindrome checkers
- String compressors
- Realtime log parsers (multi-threaded)
